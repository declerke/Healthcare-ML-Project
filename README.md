# 🏥 HealthPredict: Clinical Test Result Intelligence Platform

**HealthPredict** is a production-grade machine learning system designed to bridge the gap between raw patient admission records and automated clinical test result predictions. Built on a FastAPI backend with a PostgreSQL data store, the platform ingests 54,966 patient records, trains a RandomForest classifier to predict test outcomes as **Normal**, **Abnormal**, or **Inconclusive**, and retrains automatically every Saturday at 12:00 UTC via GitHub Actions — without human intervention.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Clinical laboratories process thousands of patient records daily, yet predicting probable test outcomes from admission metadata remains a largely manual, time-intensive task. **HealthPredict** automates this workflow: a patient's demographic and clinical admission data is submitted to a REST API, and within milliseconds a trained model returns a prediction alongside per-class probability scores. The platform is fully self-maintaining — a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow retrains the model weekly on the latest data, commits the updated artifact, and triggers a zero-downtime redeploy on Render, ensuring the model never drifts from the current data distribution.

---

## 🧬 System Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion** — `scripts/ingest.py` uses the Kaggle API to download the raw healthcare dataset (55,500 records) directly to `data/raw/`, then copies it to a stable path for downstream processing
2. **Data Cleaning** — `scripts/clean.py` standardises string casing across all categorical columns, parses date fields to ISO format, drops 534 duplicate rows, and writes `data/cleaned_healthcare.csv` (54,966 rows)
3. **Data Storage** — `scripts/load.py` bulk-loads cleaned records into **PostgreSQL** via SQLAlchemy, using `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for idempotent reloads; prediction and model version history are persisted in separate tables
4. **ML Training** — `ml/train.py` encodes 8 features (2 numeric + 6 categorical), scales numerics with `StandardScaler`, trains a **RandomForestClassifier (n=50, max_depth=15)**, evaluates on a stratified 80/20 split, and serialises both `model.joblib` (5.1 MB, joblib compress=3) and `encoders.joblib`
5. **Model Serving** — **FastAPI** exposes `POST /predict` for real-time inference; the model and encoders are loaded once at startup via the lifespan context and held in memory for sub-millisecond access
6. **Automated Retraining** — Two complementary scheduling layers: **GitHub Actions** cron (`0 12 * * 6`) runs `ml/train.py` every Saturday at noon UTC, commits the updated model artifacts, and pushes to `main` (Render auto-deploys on push); **Apache Airflow 3** (`dags/retrain_dag.py`) mirrors the same schedule for local orchestration, adding a 3-task TaskFlow pipeline with built-in monitoring, retry logic, and manual trigger capability via the Airflow UI
7. **Frontend** — A static HTML/CSS/JS page served directly by FastAPI at `GET /` submits patient data to the API and renders the prediction result with confidence scores and a probability breakdown

## 📊 Performance & Results

- **Dataset:** 54,966 clean patient records (534 duplicates removed from 55,500 raw rows)
- **Class balance:** Normal 18,331 · Abnormal 18,437 · Inconclusive 18,198 (near-perfect 3-way split)
- **Train / Test split:** 43,972 training rows · 10,994 test rows (stratified 80/20)
- **Model accuracy:** 37.7% (baseline for random 3-class prediction = 33.3%; +4.4pp above chance)
- **Macro F1-score:** 0.3771 across all three classes
- **Model artifact size:** 5.1 MB (joblib compress=3; n=50 trees, max_depth=15 — constrained to stay within GitHub's 100 MB file limit)
- **Test suite:** 23/23 tests passing (14 API integration + 9 unit tests)
- **Retraining schedule:** Every Saturday 12:00 UTC — automated, zero-touch
- **API response time:** < 50ms per prediction (model held in-memory)
- **Database tables:** `patients` (54,966 rows) · `predictions` (logs every API call) · `model_versions` (retraining audit trail)

> Note: The Kaggle dataset is synthetically generated for educational purposes with randomised feature-to-outcome relationships. The 37.7% accuracy reflects genuine learning above the random baseline on a dataset with intentionally limited causal signal. Tree depth and count are constrained to 5.1 MB to satisfy GitHub's 100 MB file size limit while preserving deployability.

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions

- **RandomForest over Logistic Regression:** Handles mixed numeric/categorical features without assuming linearity; produces calibrated `predict_proba` scores for per-class confidence display in the UI; robust to the moderate class imbalance in a 3-way split
- **Model size constraint (n=50, max_depth=15, compress=3):** An unconstrained RandomForest (n=200, unlimited depth) on 54,966 samples produces a 305 MB artifact — exceeding GitHub's 100 MB file size limit. Constraining tree count and depth, combined with joblib level-3 compression, reduces the artifact to 5.1 MB with only a 3.8pp accuracy trade-off (41.5% → 37.7%). Both figures remain meaningfully above the 33.3% random baseline
- **Python 3.11 pinned via `runtime.txt`:** Render defaults to the latest Python release (3.14 at time of deployment), which has no pre-built binary wheels for scikit-learn or pandas — causing source compilation that times out during the build. `runtime.txt` pins 3.11.9 to guarantee wheel availability
- **GitHub Actions for retraining, not APScheduler:** Render's free tier uses an ephemeral filesystem — any in-process scheduler's saved model would be lost on restart. GitHub Actions runs on a persistent Ubuntu runner, commits `model.joblib` back to the repo, and Render auto-deploys on the new commit — a stateless, infrastructure-free scheduling solution
- **Encoders saved alongside model:** `LabelEncoder` and `StandardScaler` are serialised to `models/encoders.joblib` so inference always uses the exact same vocabulary and scaling parameters as the training run that produced `model.joblib`. Mismatched encoders would silently corrupt predictions
- **`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for data loading:** Makes `scripts/load.py` idempotent — the script can be re-run after a failed partial load without creating duplicates
- **Absolute path resolution in model_loader:** `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]` anchors all file paths to the repo root regardless of the working directory at runtime — eliminates relative-path failures in test environments and deployed containers
- **Dual-layer scheduling (GitHub Actions + Airflow 3):** GitHub Actions handles the cloud retraining loop (persistent runner → commit model → Render redeploy), while Airflow 3 provides local orchestration with a visual DAG graph, per-task logs, retry policies, and a manual trigger button. The two layers share the identical cron expression (`0 12 * * 6`) and call the same `ml/train.py` logic — demonstrating that the training code is environment-agnostic
- **Airflow `LocalExecutor` with dedicated metadata DB:** Using `LocalExecutor` (vs `CeleryExecutor`) avoids Redis and Celery dependencies for a single-node demo while preserving the full Airflow 3 feature set. A separate `airflow_db` Postgres instance keeps Airflow metadata cleanly isolated from the healthcare application database
- **Airflow 3 multi-container networking fixes (three required settings):** Running Airflow 3 across separate Docker containers requires three explicit configurations that default to localhost-only values: (1) `AIRFLOW__CORE__EXECUTION_API_SERVER_URL` must point to the api-server's Docker service name instead of `localhost:8080`, or every task fails with `Connection refused`; (2) `AIRFLOW__API_AUTH__JWT_SECRET` must be identical across all containers — the scheduler signs task JWTs and the api-server verifies them, so a mismatch produces `Signature verification failed` on every task; (3) `api-server --workers 1` prevents uvicorn's multi-process spawn from generating per-worker JWT keys that diverge from the parent, causing a worker crash loop at 600%+ CPU
- **Airflow 3 `airflow.sdk` imports for DAG files:** Airflow 3 moved the `@dag` / `@task` decorators to `airflow.sdk`; importing from the legacy `airflow.decorators` path still works but incurs an additional module-resolution hop that, combined with the execution API connectivity issues above, can cause the dag-processor to timeout and kill the parser process. Using `from airflow.sdk import dag, task` is both the documented path and the more robust choice in multi-container deployments
- **SimpleAuthManager password file via bind mount:** Airflow 3 defaults to `SimpleAuthManager` (not FAB). User passwords are stored as plain text in `$AIRFLOW_HOME/simple_auth_manager_passwords.json`. Since each container has its own `AIRFLOW_HOME`, the file is written to the project bind mount (`/opt/airflow/project/`) during `airflow-init` so all containers share the same credentials file without an extra named volume

### Deploy to Render

1. Push the repository to GitHub
2. Connect the repo to [Render.com](https://render.com) — the `render.yaml` provisions the web service and PostgreSQL database automatically
3. Add `RETRAIN_API_KEY` to Render environment variables
4. Add `DATABASE_URL` as a GitHub Actions secret (`Settings → Secrets → Actions`)
5. The GitHub Actions workflow (`retrain.yml`) will retrain the model automatically every Saturday at 12:00 UTC

### Apache Airflow 3 (Local Orchestration)

Run the full stack — including the Airflow 3 API server, scheduler, DAG processor, and triggerer — with a single command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts seven containers:

| Container                | Role                                                        | Port  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| `healthcare_db`          | Application PostgreSQL (patients, predictions)              | 5434  |
| `airflow_db`             | Airflow metadata PostgreSQL (isolated)                      | 5433  |
| `airflow_init`           | One-shot: DB migrate + SimpleAuthManager passwords file     | —     |
| `airflow_api_server`     | Airflow 3 React UI + REST API (`api-server --workers 1`)    | 8080  |
| `airflow_scheduler`      | Schedules task instances via LocalExecutor                  | —     |
| `airflow_dag_processor`  | Parses DAG files (mandatory separate service in Airflow 3)  | —     |
| `airflow_triggerer`      | Handles deferrable operators                                | —     |

Once all containers are healthy (allow ~2–3 minutes for `scikit-learn==1.5.2` install on first start):

1. Open **http://localhost:8080** — login with `admin` / `admin`
2. Navigate to **DAGs → healthcare_retrain**
3. Click the **▶ Trigger DAG** button to run the pipeline manually
4. Watch the 3-task graph: `load_data → train_model → validate_artifacts`

> **Note:** The DAG is also scheduled for `0 12 * * 6` (Saturday 12:00 UTC) — identical to the GitHub Actions cron — so both orchestrators run the same retraining logic independently.
